# v1.0.3#

## Bug Fixes##

- Fix issue when uploading the same file copied in two different locations. Now EvaporateJS will treat these as different files, and not think they are the same file.

# v1.0.2#

## Features##
- Checks if window is defined before trying to access the window object in `supported`. EvaporateJS can now sucesfully be imported into a node.js environment.
- Adds an example using AWS SDK for Javascript for the `cryptoMd5Method` configuration option.

## Bug Fixes##

- Issue #124. Only enables the history cache if MD5 checksums are also enabled.

# v1.0.1#

## Features##
- Issue #117. Adds the signParams configuration to the localStorage cache for reuse when resuming uploads

## Bug Fixes##
- Issue #116. Fixes issue where the uploader would fail because localStorage is not available in incognito mode on some browsers
- Issue #115. Fixes an issue where the uploader assumed that a Blob object had a last modified date

# v1.0.0#

##Features##
- Adds MD5 checksum/digest validation, Issue #96.
- Adds ability to Abort a multipart upload (releasing AWS S3 resources), Issue #98. This change requires S3 CORS Settings
  to allow the DELETE method.
- Adds retry logic to the Initiate and Complete methods, Issue #107
- Adds ability to resume uploads, even after client or user error, Issue #104. Using this feature requires S3 CORS Settings
  to allow the HEAD method. Refer to the updated README.md for more information on the necessary bucket policy.

## Breaking Changes##
- The `complete` callback method signature has changes: a new parameter has been added `awsObjectKey` which will contain the S3 object key found
when attempting to resume uploads after client failure. This is required because it is generally required to create a randomingly unique S3 object key
to prevent namespace clashes in multi-user environments. If an object can be resued, the proposed AWS S3 object key would not be used; instead, the object key of
existing object would be required.

##Fixes##
- Addresses memory leak when retrying by releasing finished, failed or aborted XMLHttpRequest objects, Issue #100.
